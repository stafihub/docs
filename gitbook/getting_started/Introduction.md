## Introduction
### StaFi Hub
By implementing the [rToken Protocol](https://docs.stafi.io/developer/rtoken-technical-paper), StaFiHub releases liquidity of tokens staked in other chains of the Cosmos Ecosystem. Through good module design, open cross-chain-bridge design and developer incentive strategy, StaFiHub will work with other chains in the Cosmos Ecosystem and other developers to create multiple rTokens and rDex so that rToken holders can easily trade them.

The First Staking Derivative SDK will be provided for Developers so that Cosmos SDK based projects can develop its own staking derivative by using the SDK, which could be easily integrated without taking too much cost and time.

### StaFi Hub Tokens
- FIS. FIS is the native token of StaFiHub and can be used to pay fees for all transactions. FIS will also be used as a staking token to secure the PoS blockchain.
- rToken. As staking derivative, rTokens is transferable and can be used to redeem origin tokens.
